# Corgify: Corgi Up Your Life

![Banner](./corgi_icon128.png)

## About

This is a very simple Chrome extension I wrote when I first started learning how to code. All it has are photos of corgis and a short script that finds all the `img` elements and replaces them with images of corgis.

There was an attempt at a slight optimization for super wide images, but whatever. For another time.

## Known Issues

- some websites have images as background images, etc. and currently Corgify does not look for that added level of complexity
- you can't really turn off Corgify without deleting it or shutting down your browser
- corgi images will sometimes be resized

When I am less lazy, I will resolve these problems.

Right now, here is Corgify, written by baby-coder me (before I even knew git!).
